# Term project outline

Choose your adventure:

## Researcher

Choose this if you have a keen and critical curiosity for the social and environmental processes around you, you don't mind exploring data through commands, and you like the prospect of doing razer-sharp research/investigations that are precise, reproducible and free of untraceable human error (i.e. using computational research techniques, some of which have been or will be seen in this class). You like data and data visualization, and would like to explore it some more.

- Deliverable: A computational essay that carries the reader through an analysis by mixing prose, code, and computational results. The essay and related materials (input data, etc.) are to be published in a Github repository that can be set to either public or private. The guidelines and constraints are as follows:
  -	The choice of topic is up to you.
  -	Your study area should be limited to or somewhere within the island of Montreal. If you would prefer a different study area, please verify with an instructor in order to ensure data availability.
  -	Minimum 750, maximum 1000 words (excluding bibliography)
  -	You must cite at least 3 papers related to the topic you have chosen. At least one of these papers must specifically relate to methodologies that can inform your work.
  -	Depending on your strengths, you can engage with your data through the lens of exploratory data analysis (i.e. using mostly visualization and descriptive summary statistics), or delve deeper by engaging with more advanced quantitative research methods (clustering, etc. using geostatistical methods made available by libraries such as PySal, or more generic libraries lik scipy or scikit-learn, or nltk for those more textually-inclined).
  -	You can use the population data seen in this class, however you **must join at least one other field** of information to it for integration into your analysis (recall the census analyzer explored in class). In addition to population data, it is recommended that you explore another data set (however, you could just explore population data if you have a particular interest in correlations between different population variables, for example).
  -	Your work is to be published in an interactive Python (Jupyter) notebook online so that readers can interactively engage with your code and thought process. It must be accompanied by a README.md file that briefly introduces your project and which contains a link to open your project in an interactive session using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Voilà](https://voila-gallery.org/).

## Python Programmer

Choose this path if you are excited by tool building and the prospect of sharing ready-made functionality with your future self and others, if you enjoy programming, if you understand (or plan on understanding) functions well and if you are articulate and efficient enough with the English language to write technical documentation and instructions that are accessible to a wide audience.

-	Deliverable: A library of GIS and mapping tools with attached documentation. Guidelines and constraints are as follows:
-	Your tasks involve creating a series of tools which you can source from for performing basic GIS tasks and geospatial data exploration tasks.
	Your code must be accessible via function calls and organized inside a module or series of modules.
	You must create at minimum 10 separate functions that do not depend on each other (obviously you can have as many dependent or nested functions as you like). You cannot simply package existing methods (e.g. a pandas method) inside your own function and consider it added value.
	You must demonstrate relevant use of for loops, conditional statements, positional and keyword arguments, etc.
o	Your scripts must be published as a public Github repository
	Your repository must contain a README.md file utilizing relevant markdown notation that explains, in sufficient detail and using accessible language, how to set up and use your code, each function and its required and/or optional parameters (positional, keyword arguments), with links to any relevant external documentation. You may use Github’s Wiki feature if you think the documentation required is complex enough/requires organization into separate pages, but this is not necessary in most cases.
	You should also fill out all relevant repository fields to make your code as accessible as possible (tags, about panel, etc.)
  - At least one of your functions must be a useful visualization function. This means that beyond being a simple. It is especially encouraged that you explore adding functionality which might involve custom zoom levels, etc.
  - Your functions must be clear about what kind of data they require as inputs. Ideally, they should be able to accomodate a wide range of input scenarios, and return errors if 

## Data Curator
Choose this path if you are excited by open data, you are organized – archival even –, you are investigative, and logically consistent, and you like the thought of publishing a public data repository that could be of use to researchers, journalists, students and other engaged citizens.
-	Deliverable: a repository containing
